# LifecycleDemo
 This is an Android application that demonstrates the Activity Lifecycle in Android development. It logs each lifecycle method's calls (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), onRestart(), and onDestroy()) and updates the user interface to show the current state of the activity.
